 * This is PRESENTATION ONLY — it never affects the amounts Mercaria stores. A
 * stored price carries its NATIVE currency (FAIR by default, but a store may
 * price in EUR/USD/…); this context tells the price components which currency to
 * SHOW it in and supplies the FAIR-pivot rates to convert with:
 *  - `primaryCurrency` — the shopper's chosen display currency (FAIR by default).
 *  - `secondaryCurrency` — an optional fiat shown alongside the primary (`null` = none).
 *  - `dualDisplayEnabled` — whether to render the secondary figure at all.
 *  - `rates` — quote code → units of that quote per 1 FAIR (`rates.USD = 0.49`
 *    means `1 FAIR = 0.49 USD`); FAIR itself is the pivot with an implicit rate
 *    of 1, so it is not a key. Any native→display conversion pivots through FAIR.
 *
 * The provider value is supplied by the app shell (which fetches `/rates` and
 * resolves the shopper's persisted preference); components here never fetch.
